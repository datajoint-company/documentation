Availability is indicated by who is <code>assigned</code>. Issues that are <code>unassigned</code> mean that there is no one yet working on resolving the issue and the issue is available for someone to work on. If an issue has been assigned, then any additional work on that issue should be coordinated with the assignee.</p> <p>Specification: In order for issues to be properly addressed, the requirements of satisfying and closing the issue should be clear. If it is not, a label will be added as <code>unspecified</code>. This could be due to more debug info being necessary, more details on intended behavior, or perhaps that further discussion is required to determine a good solution. Feel free to help us arrive at a proper specification.</p> <p>Priority: As a community, we work on a concerted effort to bring about the realization of the milestones. We utilize milestones as a planning tool to help focus a group of changes around a release. To determine the priority of issues, simply have a look at the next milestone that is expected to arrive. Therefore, each milestone following this can be understood as lower in priority respectively. Bear in mind that much like a hurricane forecast, the execution plan is much more likely to be accurate the closer to today\u2019s date as opposed to milestones further out. Extremely low priority issues are assigned to the <code>Backburner</code> milestone. Since <code>Backburner</code> does not have a target date, this indicates that its issues may be deferred indefinitely. Occasionally the maintainers will move issues from <code>Backburner</code> as it makes sense to address them within a release. Also, issues <code>unassigned</code> to a milestone can be understood as new issues which have not been triaged.</p> <p>After considering the above, you may comment on the issue you\u2019d like to help fix and a maintainer will assign it to you.</p>","location":"community/contribute/#1-which-issue-should-i-contribute-towards"},{"title":"2) What is the proper etiquette for proposing changes as contribution?","text":"<p>What is generally expected from new contributions are the following:</p> <p>Any proposed contributor changes should be introduced in the form of a pull request (PR) from their fork.</p> <p>Proper branch target specified.

Typically as it relates to tests, this means:</p> <ol> <li>No syntax errors</li> <li>No integration errors</li> <li>No style errors e.g. PEP8, etc.</li> <li>Similar or better code coverage</li> </ol> <p>Additional documentation to reflect new feature or behavior introduced.</p> <p>Necessary updates to the changelog following Keep a Changelog convention.</p> <p>A contributor should not approve or merge their own PR.</p> <p>Reviewer suggestions or feedback should not be directly committed to a branch on a contributor\u2019s fork. A less intrusive way to collaborate would be for the reviewer to PR to the contributor\u2019s fork/branch that is associated with the main PR currently in review.</p> <p>Maintainers will also ensure that PR\u2019s have the appropriate assignment for reviewer, milestone, and project.</p>","location":"community/contribute/#2-what-is-the-proper-etiquette-for-proposing-changes-as-contribution"},{"title":"3) How can I track the progress of an issue that has been assigned?","text":"<p>Since milestones represent the development plan, projects represent the actual execution.

Python in particular has several popular ORMs such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM. The purpose of ORMs is to allow representations and manipulations of objects from the host programming language as data in a relational database. ORMs allow making objects persistent between program executions by creating a bridge (i.e., mapping) between the object model used by the host language and the relational model allowed by the database. The result is always a compromise, usually toward the object model. ORMs usually forgo key concepts, features, and capabilities of the relational model for the sake of convenient programming constructs in the language.</p> <p>In contrast, DataJoint implements a data model that is a refinement of the relational data model without compromising its core principles of data representation and queries. DataJoint supports data integrity (entity integrity, referential integrity, and group integrity) and provides a fully capable relational query language. DataJoint remains absolutely data-centric, with the primary focus on the structure and integrity of the data pipeline.

Not all manual information is entered by typing. Automated software can enter it directly into the database. What makes a manual table manual is that it does not perform any computations within the DataJoint pipeline. </p> <p>Lookup tables contain basic facts that are not specific to an experiment and are fairly persistent. In GUIs, lookup tables are often used for drop-down menus or radio buttons. In Computed tables, the contents of Lookup tables are often used to specify alternative methods for computations. Unlike Manual tables, Lookup tables can specify contents in the schema definition. For syntax, please visit the  Python and  Matlab documentation pages.</p> <p>Lookup tables are especially useful for entities with many unique features. Rather than adding many primary keys, this information can be retrieved through an index. For an example, see ClusteringParamSet in Element Array Ephys.</p>  <p>While this distinction is useful for structuring a pipeline, it is not enforced, and left to the best judgement of the researcher.</p>","location":"core/design/tables/tiers/#data-entry-lookup-and-manual"},{"title":"Automation: Imported and Computed","text":"<p>Auto-populated tables are used to define, execute, and coordinate computations in a DataJoint pipeline. These tables belong to one of the two auto-populated data tiers: Imported and Computed. The difference is not strictly enforced, but the convention helps researchers understand data provenance at a glance.</p> <p>Imported tables require access to external files, such as raw storage, outside the  database. If a entry were deleted, it could be retrieved from the raw files on disk.  An EphysRecording table, for example, would load metadata and raw data from  experimental recordings. </p>  <p>Computed tables only require to other data within the pipeline. If an entry were  deleted, it could could be recovered by simply running the relevant command. For   analysis, many pipelines feature a task table that pairs sets of primary keys ready  for computation. The  PoseEstimationTask  in Element DeepLabCut pairs videos and models. The   PoseEstimation  table executes these computations and stores the results.</p> <p>Data should never be directly inserted into auto-populated tables.

If so, Manual and/or Lookup tables are likely more appropriate. Populate and delete commands should always target the master, and never individual parts. This facilitates data integrity by treating the entire process as one transaction. Either (a) all data are inserted/committed or deleted, or (b) the entire transaction is rolled back. This ensures that partial results never appear in the database.</p> <p>As an example, Element Calcium Imaging features a MotionCorrection computed table segmenting an image into masks. The resulting correctoion is inseparable from the rigid and nonrigid correction parameters that it produces, with MotionCorrection.RigidMotionCorrection and MotionCorrection.NonRigidMotionCorrection  part tables. </p>  <p>The master-part relationship cannot be chained or nested.

We interview the core team to learn about their collaborative culture, practices, and procedures. We jointly review their open-source code and their plans for dissemination. In many cases, our team already collaborates with such teams through our other projects and we have a good understanding of their process.

The idea is that the larger     the code base, the more there is to review and maintain. Therefore, we should aim     to find a compromise where we can keep the code base from becoming too large     without adding convoluted complexity.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Performance: Performance drawbacks should be avoided, controlled, or, at least, be     properly monitored and justified.
